                <h1>Goa Martial Arts</h1>
                <p>Goal Oriented Academy Martial Arts (GOA) is a combat-sports training center based in Tbilisi, Georgia. Founded in 2025 by Nika Keshelava, the academy was created with the vision of building a disciplined environment where young athletes and adults can develop real fighting skills with a clear, measurable and result-oriented approach.

GOA delivers structured instruction in wrestling, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, boxing, and mixed fighting systems. Classes are led by highly experienced coaches who focus on precision technique, physical conditioning, fight IQ, and safe practice habits. Students learn takedowns, grappling control, striking fundamentals, and self-defense strategies that apply to both competition and real-life situations. The academy takes pride in having an outstanding head coach who works closely with athletes of all levels and promotes a culture of excellence.

Beyond physical skills, GOA trains the mind — building mental toughness, discipline, habits of consistency, and a goal-oriented mentality. Every student is encouraged to set personal targets, monitor progress, and compete when prepared. The core values of the academy are respect, performance, responsibility, and long-term development.
